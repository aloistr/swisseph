## About the Swiss Ephemeris:

Swiss Ephemeris (SE) is a software toolbox for programmers of astrological
software. It is of little use for a non-programmer

Swiss Ephemeris was developed by Dieter Koch and Alois Treindl, while both were
employed by Astrodienst AG in Zollikon/ZÃ¼rich Switzerland.

Most astrological programmers all over the world use Swiss Ephemeris in their
software. 

SE ist built according to the highest standards of precision available
in astronomical data, with raw data from Nasa's JPL. It is able to reproduce the ephemeris data in
astronomical standard books up to the last printed digit.

Detailed information is available at https://www.astro.com/swisseph
or in the documentation files included here (folder doc).

## How to organize Ephemeris files so that SwissEph finds them
Swissephe code uses an internal swed.ephepath for the directory names where it looks
for its data files.

It defaults to \sweph\ephe on Windows and to  ".:/users/ephe2/:/users/ephe/" on Linux or other
Unix-like systems like Android or Mac OS-X.

The characters ; in Windows and ; or : in Linux serve as path separators.
In the default setting on Linux, the three directories . , /users/ephe and /users/ephe2 are
searched when Swiss Ephemeris looks for a file.

The programmer can call the function swe_set_ephe_path() to set the ephepath variable,
and may include path separators.

The user of a program can also set an evironment variable which override the builtin default.

The compressed planetary ephemeris files like sepl*.se1, sem*.se1 and seas*.se1 must be directly in one of
the path elements.

Asteroid files must be in subdirectories named astN  like ast0, ast1, ... ast623,
where N is the asteroid number divided by 1000.

The folders all_ast and long_ast are only used inside the Dropbox area to organize the files. Once downloaded,
the astN directory must be placed directly in one of the elements of ephepath.
Short asteroid files and long asteroid filese differ by an s in the file name, like se1001.ses and se1001s.se1.
They can be merged into the same astN directory, in this case ast1.
Astrodienst keeps them traditionally separate in /ephe and /ephe2, but that distinction is not technically necessary.

## How to use Swetest

Swetest computes a complete set of geocentric planetary positions, for a given date or a sequence of dates. Input can either be a date or an absolute julian day number.
0:00 (midnight). With the proper options, swetest can be used to output a printed ephemeris and transfer the data into other programs like spreadsheets for graphical display.

**Version:** 2.10.03

### Help commands:

- `-?, -h` display whole info

- `-hcmd` display commands

- `-hplan` display planet numbers

- `-hform` display format characters

- `-hdate` display input date format

- `-hexamp` display examples

- `-glp` report file location of library

### Input time formats:

- `-bDATE` begin date; e.g. -b1.1.1992 if
  Note: the date format is day month year (European style).
- `-bj...` begin date as an absolute Julian day number; e.g. `-bj2415020.5`

- `-j...` same as `-bj`

- `-tHH[:MM[:SS]]` input time (as Ephemeris Time)

- `-ut` input date is Universal Time (UT1)

- `-utHH[:MM[:SS]]` input time (as Universal Time)

- `-utcHH[:MM[:SS]]` input time (as Universal Time Coordinated UTC). H,M,S can have one or two digits. Their limits are unchecked.

- Output time for eclipses, occultations, risings/settings is UT by default
  - `-lmt` output date/time is LMT (with -geopos)
  - `-lat` output date/time is LAT (with -geopos)

### Object, number of steps, step with

- `-pSEQ` planet sequence to be computed. See the letter coding below.

- `-dX` differential ephemeris: print differential ephemeris between body X and each body in list given by `-p`
  example: `-p2 -d0 -fJl -n366 -b1.1.1992` prints the longitude distance between SUN (planet `0`) and MERCURY (planet `2`)
  for a full year starting at 1 Jan 1992.

- `-dhX` differential ephemeris: print differential ephemeris between heliocentric body X and each body in list given by `-p` example: `-p8 -dh8 -ftl -n36600 -b1.1.1500 -s5` prints the longitude distance between geocentric and heliocentric Neptune (planet `8`) for 500 year starting at 1 Jan 1500. Using this option mostly makes sense for a single planet to find out how much its geocentric and heliocentric positions can differ over extended periods of time.

- `-DX` midpoint ephemeris, works the same way as the differential mode `-d` described above, but outputs the midpoint position.

- `-nN` output data for N consecutive timesteps; if no `-n` option is given, the default is `1`. If the option `-n` without a number is given, the default is `20`.

- `-sN` timestep N days, default 1. This option is only meaningful when combined with option `-n`. If an `y` is appended, the time step is in years instead of days, for example `-s10y` for a time step of 10 years. If an 'mo' is appended, the time step is in months instead of days, for example `-s3mo` for a time step of 3 months. If an `m` is appended, the time step is in minutes instead of days, for example `-s15m` for a time step of 15 minutes. If an `s` is appended, the time step is in seconds instead of days, for example `-s1s` for a time step of 1 second.

### Output format:

- `-fSEQ` use `SEQ` as format sequence for the output columns; default is `PLBRS`.

- `-head` don't print the header before the planet data. This option is useful when you want to paste the output into a spreadsheet for displaying graphical ephemeris.

- `+head` header before every step (with `-s..`).

- `-gPPP` use `PPP` as gap between output columns; default is a single blank. `-g` followed by white space sets the gap to the TAB character; which is useful for data entry into spreadsheets.

- `-hor` list data for multiple planets 'horizontally' in same line. all columns of `-fSEQ` are repeated except time colums `tTJyY`.

### Astrological house system:

- `-house[long,lat,hsys]`
  include house cusps. The longitude, latitude (degrees with DECIMAL fraction) and house system letter can be given, with commas separated, + for east and north. If none are given, Greenwich UK and Placidus is used: `0.00,51.50,p.`. The output lists 12 house cusps, Asc, MC, ARMC, Vertex, Equatorial Ascendant, co-Ascendant as defined by Walter Koch, co-Ascendant as defined by Michael Munkasey, and Polar Ascendant. Houses can only be computed if option `-ut` is given.

  - `B` Alcabitius
  - `C` Campanus
  - `D` equal / MC
  - `E` equal = A
  - `F` Carter poli-equatorial
  - `G` 36 Gauquelin sectors

    The use of lower case letters is deprecated. They will have a different meaning in future releases of Swiss Ephemeris.

- `-hsy[hsys]` house system to be used (for house positions of planets) for `long`, `lat`, `hsys`, see `-house`. The use of lower case letters is deprecated. They will have a different meaning in future releases of Swiss Ephemeris.

- `-geopos[long,lat,elev]` Geographic position. Can be used for azimuth and altitude or house cusps calculations. The longitude, latitude (degrees with DECIMAL fraction) and elevation (meters) can be given, with commas separated, + for east and north. If none are given, Greenwich is used: `0,51.5,0`. For topocentric planet positions please user the parameter `-topo`

### Solar Eclipses:

`-solecl` solar eclipse.

- **Output 1st line:**

  - Eclipse date
  - Time of maximum (UT):
  - Geocentric angle between centre of Sun and Moon reaches minimum.
  - Core shadow width (negative with total eclipses),
  - Eclipse magnitudes:
    - NASA method (= 2. with partial ecl. and ratio lunar/solar diameter with total and annular ecl.)
    - Fraction of solar diameter covered by moon; if the value is > 1, it means that Moon covers more than just the solar disk
    - Fraction of solar disc covered by moon (obscuration) with total and annular eclipses it is the ratio of the sizes of the solar disk and the lunar disk.
  - Saros series and eclipse number
  - Julian day number (6-digit fraction) of maximum

- **Output 2nd line:**

  - Start and end times for partial and total phases
  - Delta t in sec

- **Output 3rd line:**

- **Output 2nd line:**

  - Local eclipse duration for totality (zero with partial occultations)
  - Local four contacts,

## Date entry:

In the interactive mode, when you are asked for a start date, you can enter data in one of the following formats:

- `1.2.1991`: three integers separated by a nondigit character for day month year. Dates are interpreted as Gregorian after 4.10.1582 and as Julian Calendar before. Time is always set to midnight (0 h). If the three letters jul are appended to the date, the Julian calendar is used even after 1582. If the four letters greg are appended to the date, the Gregorian calendar is used even before 1582.

- `j2400123.67` the letter `j` followed by a real number, for the absolute Julian daynumber of the start date. Fraction `.5` indicates midnight, fraction `.0` indicates noon, other times of the day can be chosen accordingly.

- `<RETURN>`: repeat the last entry
- `.`: stop the program

- `+20`: advance the date by 20 days

- `-10` go back in time 10 days
