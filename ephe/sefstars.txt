# File editing History:
# ---------------------
# 7 May 1999:
# File was improved by Valentin Abramov, Tartu, Estonia in April 1999.
# - The stars are ordered by constellation.
# - Most names come from Arabic and have several transliterations, 
#   e.g. Algieba and Al Jabhah. In such cases, the record has been 
#   duplicated and both spellings have been given.
# 
# 11 Jan 2006, Dieter Koch:

# The Galactic Center was taken from 
# The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 518, Issue 1, pp. L33-L35.
