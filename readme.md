## About the Swiss Ephemeris:

Swiss Ephemeris (SE) is a software toolbox for programmers of astrological
software. It is of little use for a non-programmer

Swiss Ephemeris was developed by Dieter Koch and Alois Treindl, while both were
employed by Astrodienst AG in Zollikon/ZÃ¼rich Switzerland.

Most astrological programmers all over the world use Swiss Ephemeris in their
software. 

SE ist built according to the highest standards of precision available
in astronomical data, with raw data from Nasa's JPL. It is able to reproduce the ephemeris data in
astronomical standard books up to the last printed digit.

Detailed information is available at https://www.astro.com/swisseph
or in the documentation files included here (folder doc).

## How to organize Ephemeris files so that SwissEph finds them
Swissephe code uses an internal swed.ephepath for the directory names where it looks
for its data files.

It defaults to \sweph\ephe on Windows and to  ".:/users/ephe2/:/users/ephe/" on Linux or other
Unix-like systems like Android or Mac OS-X.

The characters ; in Windows and ; or : in Linux serve as path separators.
In the default setting on Linux, the three directories . , /users/ephe and /users/ephe2 are
searched when Swiss Ephemeris looks for a file.

The programmer can call the function swe_set_ephe_path() to set the ephepath variable,
and may include path separators.

The user of a program can also set an evironment variable which override the builtin default.

The compressed planetary ephemeris files like sepl*.se1, sem*.se1 and seas*.se1 must be directly in one of
the path elements.

Asteroid files must be in subdirectories named astN  like ast0, ast1, ... ast623,
where N is the asteroid number divided by 1000.
To locate asteroid files, we organize them into subdirectories labeled astN, where N corresponds to the asteroid number divided by 1000 in dropbox. For example, to find information about asteroid 433 (also known as Eros), divide its number by 1000, resulting in 0.433. In the ast0 directory, you'll find the file named 00433s.se1, accessible via Dropbox.

The folders all_ast and long_ast are only used inside the Dropbox area to organize the files. Once downloaded,
the astN directory must be placed directly in one of the elements of ephepath.
Short asteroid files and long asteroid filese differ by an s in the file name, like se1001.ses and se1001s.se1.
They can be merged into the same astN directory, in this case ast1.
Astrodienst keeps them traditionally separate in /ephe and /ephe2, but that distinction is not technically necessary.
