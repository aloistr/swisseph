# sefstars.txt: Swiss Ephemeris fixed stars data file, 
# Fixed stars brighter than Magnitude 5 
# This file is based on data provided by S. Moshier.
# It was later increased and improved by Valentin Abramov and Dieter Koch
# (see history further below).
#
# The data in a star record are:
# traditional name (no leading blanks in field)
# nomenclature name (no leading blanks in field)
# equinox (must be either '1950' or '2000' or 'ICRS')
# right ascension hours
#               minutes
#               seconds
# declination   degrees
#               minutes
#               seconds
# proper motion in right asc., 0.001"/year * cos(decl0)
#               in decl., 0.001"/year
# radial velocity in km/s
# annual parallax in 0.001"
# magnitude V
# DM zone (Durchmusterung zone; declination 1900)
# DM number 
# The last two parameters are not supported and are not required for 
# the file to be valid (since SE 2.07).
#
# To achieve higher speed for swe_fixstar(), you can copy the 
# stars you prefer to the top of the list
#
# File editing History:
# ---------------------
# 7 May 1999:
# File was improved by Valentin Abramov, Tartu, Estonia in April 1999.
# - The stars are ordered by constellation.
# - Most names come from Arabic and have several transliterations, 
#   e.g. Algieba and Al Jabhah. In such cases, the record has been 
#   duplicated and both spellings have been given.
# 
# 11 Jan 2006, Dieter Koch:
# File updated with data from the SIMBAD Astronomical Database.
# http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-fid
# 
# The Galactic Center was taken from 
# The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 518, Issue 1, pp. L33-L35.
